pgxsim
======

The pgxsim package provides functions to simulate dose response data from cell lines given a known genetic effect on drug response. It also provides functions to explore different methodologies to retrieve the genetic association. Together these provide the basis to carry out simulation studies to inform experimental and analysis design.
